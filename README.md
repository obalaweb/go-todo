# Go To-Do

Welcome to the Go To-Do application! This project is a simple to-do list application built using Go. It allows users to manage their tasks via a RESTful API.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete to-do items.
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses PostgreSQL for storing to-do items.
- **RESTful API**: Provides endpoints for managing tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/obalaweb/go-todo.git
   cd go-todo
   ```

Set Up the Database

Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running. Create a database for the application:

sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE todo_db;
Configuration

Create a .env file in the root directory and set the necessary environment variables:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/todo_db
